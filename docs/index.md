## About
I am an associate professor at School of Computer Science and Technology,
Xi'an Jiaotong University.
I received my B.E. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2013,
and Ph.D. degree in 2018 from Tsinghua University.
<!-- My research interests include data center networking and congestion control. -->
