!!! note "Looking for self-motivated students"

    Iâ€™m looking for self-motivated Ph.D./Master/Undergraduate students to work with me.
    If you are interested in my research, feel free to contact me.


## About
I am an associate professor at School of Computer Science and Technology,
Xi'an Jiaotong University.
I received my B.E. degree from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2013,
and Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University in 2018.
<!-- My research interests include data center networking and congestion control. -->
